# Monty Hall Python Game

Welcome to the Monty Hall Game! This is a simple Python project that simulates the classic Monty Hall problem with three doors. One door hides a brand new red convertible car, while the other two hide goats. Test your luck and strategy by choosing a door, and then decide whether to stick with your choice or switch after one of the goat doors is revealed.

## Overview

The Monty Hall game is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. In this version:
- There are **three doors**.
- **One door** hides a red convertible car (the prize).
- The **other two doors** hide goats.
- After the player picks a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat.
- The player then gets the option to either stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door.
- Finally, the chosen door is opened to reveal if the player wins the car or gets a goat.
